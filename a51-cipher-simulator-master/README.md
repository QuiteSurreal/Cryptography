# A5/1 cipher simulator written in HTML/Javascript

This simulator visualizes the internal algorithms of the broken [A5/1 cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A5/1), that was used in the GSM standard to encrypt the commmunication data.

You can go over every step from the key initialization to the register initialization and finally to the cipherstream generation. The state change of the maj() function and of all 3 registers can be observed for each step. The used key is hardcoded in the file and can be changed of course.

The simulator is just for general understanding and our implementation is probably not absolute correct!
